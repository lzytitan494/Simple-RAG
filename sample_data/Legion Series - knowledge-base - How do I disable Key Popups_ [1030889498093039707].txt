**In Lenovo Hotkeys App**
Go to Settings > Disable CapsLk / NumLock OSD.

**With Legion Toolkit**
Go to Settings > Disable Hotkeys 

**Remove Pop Ups completely without Toolkit**
1. Open start menu and search for services.msc
2. Find Lenovo Fn and function keys service
3. Double click on the service, or you can right click the service and press properties
4. Change Startup type to Disabled
5. Afterwards, if the service hasn't stopped, click stop
6. Don't forget to disable Lenovo Hotkeys in Task Manager -> Startup

and you're done. Note that this will also disable Fn lock popup and FN+Q popup as it disables the entire Lenovo Hotkeys application.
