```diff
- If you have Gen 7 or above with S0 / Modern Standby enabled, Performance Power Plan will not work. 

+ It is recommended to use the stock balanced power plan in Windows
```
Enter this command in an elevated prompt to see available power states
```powercfg /a```


Extract the attached zip and run setup.cmd with admin privileges.
Legion Balanced mode is the same as Windows provided Balanced. 
2021 and 2022 Balanced and Performance versions have no differences.

Legion Quiet and Performance plans have additional tweaks for better performance and efficiency.
Legion Quiet 2022 gives better performance than 2021 version, for further details:

**If anyone has the issue where they could see Performance plan with Vantage but can't with LLT**
1. Enable Vantage
2. Swap to regular Balanced power plan
3. Delete Legion power plans
4. Open LegionPowerPlans 202x 
5. Clean POWER.LOG and save
6. Run Setup.bat
7. Check if you have all power plans by running Fn+Q
8. Use powersettingsexplorer to make it so Legion Performance power plan is Balanced instead of High Performance
9. Disable Vantage
