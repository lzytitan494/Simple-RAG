**Update**: I want to let everyone know that I made the issue to the reddit NVIDIA driver threads and let m_w_h (who is in charge of handling/reporting the nvidia driver issues) know about this.
My main post can be followed here:

**THIS ISSUE IS HAPPENING ONLY ON GEN 6 DEVICES. (2021 LEGIONS)**


Every driver past **511.23** broke G-Sync for most users. Having G-Sync on causes micro stuttering, overshoot and flickering in certain games. If you notice any of these, try to turn G-Sync off and see if it's the cause of your problems. 
It was forwarded to Nvidia and to Reddit already. A fix is yet to be announced/published, however, might take a good chunk of time and patience until that will happen.
This issue is also present on Samsung, LG, Gigabyte and perhaps few other monitor manufacturers, so it can affect desktop users as well. **IT IS NOT A LEGION ONLY ISSUE. It's a driver-level problem so it's all on NVIDIA to fix.**
You can read more info about it here:

**Main culprit to this can be the Vesa VRR implementation, which perhaps got some new pipeline added or modification in the upcoming drivers past 511.23 and that caused problems with G-Sync aftewards since Legion displays are just G-sync Compatible which translates to being Vesa VRR/Freesync Screen. Based on more research & help from Kira, we managed to pinpoint a route that leads to panels that are lacking DSC support will be prone to g-sync issues. Precisely any panel from 2021 to 2022 that is not a late CSOT T3 MNG007DA1-8 2021 model. Anything other than the one mentioned are lacking DSC support which makes them be prone to G-Sync problems.**


If you still want to use G-Sync, despite having the above issue(s), trying one of these methods can fix your problems:


â€¢ Turning on HDR in Windows.
â€¢ Lowering in-game resolution by 1 step. (Example: from 2560x1600 to 2560x1440)
â€¢ Capping the FPS using the Nvidia Control Panel or RTSS software. (Riva Statistics Tuner that comes alongside MSI Afterburner) For example: your game runs at 80 average FPS and capping it to 60 FPS will prevent any G-Sync stutter/micro stutter or flickering from happening as long as the fps can be sustained around the selected cap.
â€¢ Turning Hybrid/Optimus ON (so that the iGPU can handle the main display and the NVIDIA GPU will handle the game itself) should prevent the flickering.
â€¢ Downgrading to an older driver before  the G-Sync got broken, such as 511.23 or below.
