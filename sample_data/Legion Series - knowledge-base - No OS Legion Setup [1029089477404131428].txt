How to set up your no-OS Legion 5/5Pro

Gen 7+ devices may require an external mouse since the drivers for the touchpad are not included in the ISO.

- Go to BIOS and make sure Boot mode is set to UEFI (it may available only on the L5)
- Create a bootable Windows USB media (ie. Rufus) and boot choosing the EFI drive on the boot menu pressing F12
- If you want to skip MS account sign in on windows, use this guide - <https://www.windowscentral.com/how-set-windows-11-without-microsoft-account>
(May need to disable SecureBoot in BIOS)
- If you want to avoid the installation of apps like Tiktok and Candy Crush by Microsoft, set your Language to ``English (World)`` during setup. Change to English US or your locale after set up.
- Activate Windows
- (Optional) Install and activate Office
- Install Lenovo Vantage from the MS Store, switch to hybrid mode, restart, search for driver updates and install them
